# üåç Global Climate Change: An Exploratory Data Analysis for Policy Insights

## 1. Introduction

This project is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a global climate change dataset, undertaken as a challenge for the Deep Data Hackathon 2.0. The primary objective is to act as a data consultant for an international environmental agency, exploring historical climate data to uncover patterns, generate actionable insights, and propose data-driven policy recommendations to combat climate change.

The analysis focuses on understanding the relationships between various climate indicators, such as temperature, CO‚ÇÇ emissions, and renewable energy adoption, across different countries and over time.

## 2. Dataset üíæ

The analysis is based on the [Climate Change Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhadramohit/climate-change-dataset). The dataset includes the following key indicators:
- Year
- Country
- Average Temperature (¬∞C)
- CO‚ÇÇ Emissions (Tons/Capita)
- Sea Level Rise (mm)
- Rainfall (mm)
- Population
- Renewable Energy (%)
- Extreme Weather Events
- Forest Area (%)

## 3. Analytical Approach üó∫Ô∏è

The project followed a structured EDA roadmap:
1.  **Data Cleaning & Preparation:** Handled missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies to ensure data quality.
2.  **Question Formulation:** Developed 10 targeted analytical questions to guide the exploration.
3.  **Visualization & Analysis:** Used Python libraries to create a variety of charts (line, bar, scatter, heatmaps) to answer the questions and uncover trends.
4.  **Insight Generation:** Synthesized the findings from the analysis into 5-7 key insights.
5.  **Policy Recommendations:** Translated the insights into 3-5 actionable policy proposals.

## 4. Key Insights üí°

Based on the analysis, the following key insights were generated:

1.  **Persistent Warming Trend:** The data confirms a clear and persistent global warming trend over the past several decades.
2.  **Lagging Renewable Adoption:** The global adoption of renewable energy is still in its early stages, with a vast majority of countries lagging in the transition away from fossil fuels.
3.  **Strong CO‚ÇÇ-Temperature Link:** There is a strong positive correlation between CO‚ÇÇ emissions and average temperatures, providing clear evidence that greenhouse gas output is a key driver of warming.
4.  **Inconclusive Forest-Weather Link:** The analysis did not reveal a significant correlation between a country's forest area and the number of extreme weather events it experiences within this dataset.
5.  **Rising Per-Capita Emissions:** There is a clear upward trend in CO‚ÇÇ emissions per capita over time, suggesting that global industrial and consumption patterns are intensifying greenhouse gas output.

## 5. Policy Recommendations üèõÔ∏è

The following data-driven policy proposals were formulated:

1.  **Global Carbon Tax & Dividend:** Implement a global tax on carbon emissions, with the revenue distributed back to citizens to offset costs and incentivize a green transition.
2.  **Renewable Energy Infrastructure Grants:** Create a government-funded grant and subsidy program to make it cheaper and more profitable for the private sector to invest in and build renewable energy projects.
3.  **National Reforestation Initiative:** Launch a nationwide program that combines corporate mandates and community-driven events to rapidly increase a country's forest cover.
